RUN ARTIFACTORY AS DOCKER CONTAINER WITHOUT MOUNTING
    When I run Artifactory as docker container without mounting everything
    seems to work fine. After logging in to the web gui I can see the
    pre-configured Docker registries. Any changes I make such as adding
    users, groups, perminssions etc will not be persisted though.
